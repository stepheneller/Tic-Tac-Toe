Tic-Tac-Toe

Play with a friend or against the computer!

The computer has three separate difficulties:
 - easy
    - will choose a random space available on the board
 - medium
    - will try to get or prevent tic-tac-toes, or will choose a random space
 - hard
    - has some logic based on going first or second, and where the player picks
    - can you beat the hard computer? Let me know if you can!

To get started make sure all of the relevant files are in the same directory and then run the main.py in an IDE or the terminal

The only module needed is the random module
